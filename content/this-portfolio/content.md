### Problem

I was missing a centralized place to showcase both my commercial and non-commercial experience including my open-source contributions (for code samples).

### Solution

Simple React Single Page Application you are using right now. Designed and created from scratch. Content is generated from a directory structure with markdown files. All animations are GPU accelerated, and routing should be friendly. Tested using both unit (Jest) and end-to-end (Cypress) tests with over 95% test coverage.
