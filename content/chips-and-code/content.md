## Description

One of the most popular courses on computing basics "taught at 400+ universities, high schools, and bootcamps" - [Nand2Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) - has one problem: it is supported by an older Java desktop application with usability concerns. While the use of devices incapable of running Java desktop apps is mostly a matter of preference in developed countries, many households in developing countries are simply unable to use desktop applications.

That is why I have decided to show even apps that involve parsers and interpreters can be efficiently implemented on the web while reaping some usability and inclusion benefits. To gather the relevant data, I ran a [comparative study](https://thesis.chipsandcode.com) collecting quantitative data. Participants who used a version of the learning content with my software completed the work in one-third of the time (`512 ± 190s` vs `1497 ± 326s`, `α = 0.05`, `p < 0.001`) and experienced considerably fewer confusing situations (`p < 0.001`).

## Noteworthy challenges

- Usability optimizations with a focus on efficiency.
- Performance and loading time (bundle size) optimizations.
- Objective quantitative usability study.
- Extensive technical writing.
