Together with my team, we transformed a software used by one client into the leading offering of its kind used worldwide by organizations from America (USADA in North America and CONMEBOL in South America) through Europe (e.g. FIFA) to Asia and Australia (e.g. Korea Anti Doping Agency and Sport Integrity Australia). Over the years, we were lucky enough to be part of countless major events, including the first-ever paperless doping controls done during the Olympic games - Tokyo 2020 and Beijing 2022.

As the second technical person to join the team, I had a significant impact on many parts of the product:

- Technical design and implementation of the majority of an offline-first mobile application used for the execution of doping controls.
- Technical design and implementation of a web application and related innovative parts of the product.
- Spearheading technical improvements in the areas of security, reliability, and performance.
- Leading the technical development in a team growing from two to a dozen people.

## Noteworthy challenges

Selected challenges I had a significant impact on as a software engineer include:

- Secure processing of data from hundreds of thousands of athletes and passing of penetration testing by leading security organizations from across the world.
- Reliable interpretation of data in different time zones and locales.
- Complex business logic reflected in non-trivial validation and synchronization.
- Connection with a third-party service without a relevant API, which represents a key differentiator.
- Support for a wide range of platforms (including older versions) and device sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
