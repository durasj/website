### Problem

Existing software used for the mobile anti-doping controls was relatively harder to maintain, tied mostly to one client and did not fully meet the UI/UX expectations. With the growing set of features and possibility of expansion to more clients in, at the time, industry using mostly paper forms, it was not enough.

### Solution

I worked, as a part of a team, on several parts. I worked on a majority of:

  - Mobile application
  - PDF forms

And to some extent on a Web application and API.

Together, we helped to create leading paperless mobile doping controls recognized and used internationally.

#### Mobile Application

Ionic 1 (AngularJS) offline first heavily styled application. Works on all platforms and device sizes (including desktop). Contains relatively complex business logic of validation and synchronization.

#### PDF Forms

HTML templates rendered and saved by a headless WebKit browser. Written from scratch. Optimized for legibility and support for Unicode characters.

#### Web Application and API

Extending existing features of the PHP backend.

Notable is a creation of a system used to export data to a 3rd party without an API or use of HTTP requests that could be simulated. A headless browser had to be used along with a defensive coding style to work in a challenging environment.
