## Description

Together with my team, we transformed a software used by one client into the leading offering used worldwide by anti-doping organizations from North and South America, through Europe, to Asia and Australia. Over the years, it was used for countless major events, including [Tokyo 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20230603034844/https://pwc-gmbh.de/digital-anti-doping-controls-at-the-tokyo-summer-olympics/) and [Beijing 2022](https://archive.org/details/2022-beijing-io-report-olympic-winter-games-final-en) - the very first Olympic games where the doping controls were conducted digitally thanks also to our software.

As the second technical person to join the team, I had a significant impact on many parts of the product:

- Technical design and implementation of the majority of an offline-first mobile application used for the execution of doping controls.
- Technical design and implementation of a web application and related innovative parts of the product.
- Spearheading technical improvements in the areas of security, reliability, and performance.
- Leading the technical development in a team growing from two to ten people.

## Noteworthy challenges

Selected challenging aspects of the software I had a significant impact on include:

- Secure processing of data from hundreds of thousands of athletes and passing of penetration testing by leading security organizations from across the world.
- Reliable collection and interpretation of data in different time zones and locales.
- Complex business logic reflected in non-trivial validation and synchronization.
- Integration with a third-party service without an API - a unique selling point.
- Support for a wide range of platforms (including older versions) and device sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
