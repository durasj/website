# Personal Website
Repo for my simple personal portfolio hosted at duras.me. There isn't a lot to see, but you are free to look around.

Content is managed as a directory structure with markdown files and photos.

```
|- content/ - Projects - each in its own dir with content.md and photos subdir
|- cypress/ - Cypress E2E test files.
|- src/     - Source code
|- static/  - Static files copied as-is to dist/
|- testing/ - Files related to unit testing like mocks and coverage.
|- *.*      - Configuration files and other files.
```

## TODO Content Generator

- Better, optimized images (raw images with optimization at build time, better serving).

## TODO Content

- iERP.ai
- Octosign
- Pixea
- LaserProfile
- Maybe one item for all IoT side projects?
